            <h2 class="section-two__title">About Me</h2>
            <p class="section-two__description">My name is Jerine Joshwa, and I am a passionate and detail-oriented web developer dedicated to building engaging, user-friendly websites and web applications. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React and Tailwind CSS, I specialize in crafting responsive, functional, and visually appealing digital experiences. My journey in web development began with curiosity and quickly evolved into a deep commitment to learning and creating meaningful online solutions.

I have hands-on experience in front-end and back-end development, using tools like Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to build full-stack applications. I also enjoy designing clean and intuitive interfaces using Figma and Adobe XD, blending both design and development to create smooth user experiences. I believe that the best web solutions are built with collaboration, creativity, and a user-first mindset.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve worked on portfolio sites, e-commerce platforms, real-time apps, and college projects, always striving to improve performance, accessibility, and usability. I'm comfortable working in agile teams, using Git, GitHub, and project management tools to keep workflows smooth and efficient.</p>
